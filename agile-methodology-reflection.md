# Agile Methodology Reflection 

## Prompt 
As a group, answer the questions below. For each of these questions, consider specific examples to support your narrative.

* Reflect on your team's communication processes. How did Agile practices, such as **daily stand-up** meetings, facilitate communication and collaboration among team members?
  - Through the usage of agile practices, we were able to be on same page and be aware of the progress we made individually and as a group. This means a combination of what is the focus for today, what have we started but is not completed yet, why is it not completed yet, what is not started yet and etc.. It was especially essential in our case as we had to work remotely due to one of us feeling unwell and some of the plans did not play out as well as we planned. 

* How did maintaining a **scrum board** play a role in the organization and delegation of tasks in your project?
  - There are multiple ways where a scrum board has guided us throughout our project. It was a place for us to establish the project we wanted to work on conceptually with features and where we gathered most/all of the necessary information. From determining the project features', tasks were then produced as a result. Seeing how some of the tasks are connected with one another, it made sense for them to be grouped together. We delegated the tasks based on whoever wanted whichever group of tasks.

* Reflect on your team's prioritization of tasks. How did your team create a **timeline for reaching MVP** and how did this prioritization assist in accomplishing your goals?
  - When creating the timeline, we followed the order of how our project would look like in the end. For example, when running our project, the user goes through the main page, selection page, battle page, and then announcement page. With each page, it has its own set of tasks and we followed their order. We realized we were behind on our schedule, so we discussed what features needed to be put away for another time to produce a MVP as soon as possible. 

* What would you have done differently as a group to improve your communication, prioritization, or delegation of tasks?
  - One of the events we would have done differently is making sure that we had a good API to work with before diving deep into the rest of the proposal. Seeing how we had to redo our proposal, it has made us rush the process in creating another one. By rushing the proposal process, it has caused some confusion on what was needed to be done. Due to how the tasks were delegated and the dates/times were not strictly followed, we were falling behind on time. The solutions we had to adapt to are tasks we redistributed differently and some of the features needed to be put on the side instead of being part of the MVP. Next time, we should limit the amount of time we are stuck on something and get help sooner.
